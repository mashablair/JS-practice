# JS-practice
This is my practice file as I learn JavaScript on SoloLearn.com.  

Here are the notes I've been taking while taking this course:

JS scripting language works inside the web browser.  Website scripts run either client side (brownser, ex. html, css, js) or server side (server of the website, ex. php, ruby).  

JS is a client side scripting language.  It runs on my computer after I've loaded the web page containing the script.  But as JS became more popular --> it's now used in apps, like Adobe Photoshop + in server side, like Node.js and Google Apps Script.

JS lives inside the html doc. It must be inserted in <script></script>.  And be placed in <head> or <body>.  

Ex.:
<body>
  <script>document.write("Hello world!");</script>
</body>
Output: it will print Hello world! to the browser. 

document.write() -- is a function that writes a string, text or html.  It should only be used for testing.  

Just like in html, we can use <tags> to format text for JS.  Ex.: document.write("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");

Adding JS to a page:  any number of scripts can be added to html file. Typically <script> is placed in the <head>. But if placing <script> in <body> - place it at the bottom to improve page load and avoid 'white screen of death'.  So that html display is not blocked by script loading.
